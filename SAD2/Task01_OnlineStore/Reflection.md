# Reflection - Task 01

## What I learned
During this task, I deepened my understanding of how to structure a complex system using Java. I learned how to manage relationships between multiple classes, such as how a `Customer` interacts with a `Cart` to produce an `Order`. I also practiced implementing static data management using a `Store` class to keep track of products and categories across the application.

## What was challenging
One of the main challenges was managing the logic for the shopping cart and ensuring that the `Admin` changes (like adding or removing products) were correctly reflected for the `Customer`. Handling user input via the `Scanner` class in a loop while maintaining a clean console interface also required careful planning.

## What I improved from previous tasks
Compared to earlier exercises, I improved my ability to use **Inheritance** effectively by creating a robust `User` hierarchy. I also focused more on **Encapsulation** to ensure that the internal state of objects like `Product` and `Order` is only modified through controlled methods, making the code more maintainable and less prone to errors.
