# Task 01: Online Store System (Roky)

## Description
The goal of this task was to design and implement a console-based **Online Store Management System** using Java. The project focuses on applying **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, including:
- **Inheritance**: Using a base `User` class for `Customer` and `Admin`.
- **Encapsulation**: Protecting data using private fields and public getters/setters.
- **Abstraction**: Defining common behaviors for different types of users.
- **Composition**: Managing relationships between `Cart`, `Order`, and `Product`.

## Requirements
- Minimum of 8 classes.
- Implementation of core OOP concepts.
- Functional features for both Admins (managing products/categories) and Customers (shopping, cart management, and checkout).
